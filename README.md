# Alzheimer-s-and-Dementia-Predictive-Model
# Problem
Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. A term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. 

Medical advancements over the years led to significant gain in life expectancy, however, one of the downside of this feat is increase in cases of dementia which is expected to continue into the nearest future.

Early detection of  dementia can help prevent or delay complications and improve interventions to slow down the progression.

# Solution
This model was designed to predict various stages of Alzheimer’s using imaging data, then take necessary action depending on output
Use representative images including mild, moderate, very mild and non-dementia cases to train and test model.
Predict the class as target and select algorithm with favorable performance metrics.
Deploy champion model in Azure machine learning workspace for production.
Run model with net new images to determine class and apply specific variation of use case. 

# Outcome
Decrease in overall healthcare burden.

Increase in activity of daily living, life span of members and quality of life.
